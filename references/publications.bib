  abstract = {It is challenging for scientists to collect oceanographic data in nearshore environments because the high amount of wave energy present in these areas makes it difficult to deploy autonomous sensors. To address this issue, scientists at Scripps Institute of Oceanography have developed the Smartfin--a surfboard fin with wireless embedded sensors--since the surf zone encompasses the same coastal regions that these scientists are interested in studying. However, collecting oceanic data with the Smartfin poses new problems, as surfer movement may now potentially bias the information being collected. Therefore, this research explores the use of robust machine learning algorithms to determine how a surfer is moving on his or her board. This research is based on surf sessions recorded around the University of California San Diego’s campus, and includes the following locations: La Jolla Shores (La Jolla, CA), Scripps Pier (La Jolla, CA), and K-38 (Baja California, Mexico). The machine learning models experimented with in this thesis include: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines with linear and non-linear kernels. Through the use of feature engineering on a dataset taken from a single surf session, we were able to predict the following classes: floating, paddling, and surfing with 86% accuracy. However, our mean classification accuracy drops to 70% when training and testing subsets are taken from the combined dataset of all surf sessions, where oceanic conditions within the dataset become more variable. Future work will need to be done to determine whether this level of classification accuracy is adequate for oceanographers who are using the Smartfin to collect data for scientific purposes.},

	abstract = {Coastal populations and hazards are escalating simultaneously, leading to an increased importance of coastal ocean observations. Many well-established observational techniques are expensive, require complex technical training, and offer little to no public engagement. Smartfin, an oceanographic sensor–equipped surfboard fin and citizen science program, was designed to alleviate these issues. Smartfins are typically used by surfers and paddlers in surf zone and nearshore regions where they can help fill gaps between other observational assets. Smartfin user groups can provide data-rich time-series in confined regions. Smartfin comprises temperature, motion, and wet/dry sensing, GPS location, and cellular data transmission capabilities for the near-real-time monitoring of coastal physics and environmental parameters. Smartfin's temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.05 °C relative to a calibrated Sea-Bird temperature sensor. Data products for quantifying ocean physics from the motion sensor and additional sensors for water quality monitoring are in development. Over 300 Smartfins have been distributed around the world and have been in use for up to five years. The technology has been proven to be a useful scientific research tool in the coastal ocean—especially for observing spatiotemporal variability, validating remotely sensed data, and characterizing surface water depth profiles when combined with other tools—and the project has yielded promising results in terms of formal and informal education and community engagement in coastal health issues with broad international reach. In this article, we describe the technology, the citizen science project design, and the results in terms of natural and social science analyses. We also discuss progress toward our outreach, education, and scientific goals.}

Our project proposes the creation of a data processing framework to generate accurate wave statistic information from data collected by the Smartfin. Specifically, we perform spectral and wave-train analysis on Smartfin IMU data to determine significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction. This project will drastically increase the spatial density of oceanographic measurements.},
