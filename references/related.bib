  abstract  = {The surf-zone presents unique challenges and opportunities for observational oceanography. Physical and biogeochemical signals change quickly in and around breaking surface waves due to high magnitudes of momentum and mass transfer. Autonomous instruments can be challenging to deploy in this energetic zone. We are developing the Smartfin, a surfboard fin capable of measuring geolocated ocean chemistry data to enable surf-zone observations via a new citizen/surfer science initiative. The Smartfin collects GPS, temperature, and motion data; modules for measurements of pH, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll fluorescence are in development. The fin is used by citizen/surfer scientists with a goal of distributing over one hundred Smartfins in California in 2017 and rapidly expanding across the country and the world in coming years.},

  abstract  = {The accuracy and precision of satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products in nearshore coastal waters are not well known, owing to a lack of in-situ data available for validation. It has been suggested that recreational watersports enthusiasts, who immerse themselves in nearshore coastal waters, be used as a platform to improve sampling and fill this gap. One tool that has been used worldwide by surfers is the Smartfin, which contains a temperature sensor integrated into a surfboard fin. If tools such as the Smartfin are to be considered for satellite validation work, they must be carefully evaluated against state-of-the-art techniques to quantify data quality. In this study, we developed a Simple Oceanographic floating Device (SOD), designed to float on the ocean surface, and deployed it during the 28th Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT28) research cruise (September and October 2018). We attached a Smartfin to the underside of the SOD, which measured temperature at a depth of ∼0.1 m, in a manner consistent with how it collects data on a surfboard. Additional temperature sensors (an iButton and a TidbiT v2), shaded and positioned a depth of ∼1 m, were also attached to the SOD at some of the stations. Four laboratory comparisons of the SOD sensors (Smartfin, iButton and TidbiT v2) with an accurate temperature probe (±0.0043 K over a range of 273.15 to 323.15 K) were also conducted during the AMT28 voyage, over a temperature range of 290–309 K in a recirculating water bath. Mean differences (𝛿), referenced to the temperature probe, were removed from the iButton (𝛿=0.292 K) and a TidbiT v2 sensors (𝛿=0.089 K), but not from the Smartfin, as it was found to be in excellent agreement with the temperature probe (𝛿=0.005 K). The SOD was deployed for 20 min periods at 62 stations (predawn and noon) spanning 100 degrees latitude and a gradient in SST of 19 K. Simultaneous measurements of skin SST were collected using an Infrared Sea surface temperature Autonomous Radiometer (ISAR), a state-of-the-art instrument used for satellite validation. Additionally, we extracted simultaneous SST measurements, collected at slightly different depths, from an underway conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) system. Over all 62 stations, the mean difference (𝛿) and mean absolute difference (𝜖) between Smartfin and the underway CTD were −0.01 and 0.06 K respectively (similar results obtained from comparisons between Smartfin and iButton and Smartfin and TidbiT v2), and the 𝛿 and 𝜖 between Smartfin and ISAR were 0.09 and 0.12 K respectively. In both comparisons, statistics varied between noon and predawn stations, with differences related to environmental variability (wind speed and sea-air temperature differences) and depth of sampling. Our results add confidence to the use of Smartfin as a citizen science tool for evaluating satellite SST data, and data collected using the SOD and ISAR were shown to be useful for quantifying near-surface temperature gradients.},

  abstract  = {Coastal populations and hazards are escalating simultaneously, leading to an increased importance of coastal ocean observations. Many well-established observational techniques are expensive, require complex technical training, and offer little to no public engagement. Smartfin, an oceanographic sensor–equipped surfboard fin and citizen science program, was designed to alleviate these issues. Smartfins are typically used by surfers and paddlers in surf zone and nearshore regions where they can help fill gaps between other observational assets. Smartfin user groups can provide data-rich time-series in confined regions. Smartfin comprises temperature, motion, and wet/dry sensing, GPS location, and cellular data transmission capabilities for the near-real-time monitoring of coastal physics and environmental parameters. Smartfin's temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0.05 °C relative to a calibrated Sea-Bird temperature sensor. Data products for quantifying ocean physics from the motion sensor and additional sensors for water quality monitoring are in development. Over 300 Smartfins have been distributed around the world and have been in use for up to five years. The technology has been proven to be a useful scientific research tool in the coastal ocean—especially for observing spatiotemporal variability, validating remotely sensed data, and characterizing surface water depth profiles when combined with other tools—and the project has yielded promising results in terms of formal and informal education and community engagement in coastal health issues with broad international reach. In this article, we describe the technology, the citizen science project design, and the results in terms of natural and social science analyses. We also discuss progress toward our outreach, education, and scientific goals.},

  abstract  = {Nearshore coastal waters are among the most dynamic regions on the planet and difficult to sample from conventional oceanographic platforms. It has been suggested that environmental sampling of the nearshore could be improved by mobilising vast numbers of citizens who partake in marine recreational sports, like surfing. In this paper, we compared two approaches for measuring sea surface temperature (SST), an Essential Climate Variable, when surfing. One technique involved attaching a commercially-available miniature temperature logger (Onset UTBI-001 TidbiT v2) to the leash of the surfboard (tether connecting surfer and surfboard) and the second, attaching a surfboard fin (Smartfin) that contained an environmental sensor package. Between July 2017 and July 2018, 148 surfing sessions took place, 90 in the southwest UK and 58 in San Diego, California, USA. During these sessions, both Smartfin and leash sensors were deployed simultaneously. On the leash, two TidbiT v2 sensors were attached, one with (denoted LP) and one without (denoted LU) a protective boot, designed to shield the sensor from sunlight. The median temperature from each technique, during each surfing session, was extracted and compared along with independent water temperature data from a nearby pier and benthic logger, and matched with photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) data from satellite observations (used as a proxy for solar radiation during each surf). Results indicate a mean difference (𝛿) of 0.13 °C and mean absolute difference (𝜖) of 0.14 °C between Smartfin and LU, and a 𝛿 of 0.04 °C and an 𝜖 of 0.06 °C between Smartfin and LP. For UK measurements, we observed better agreement between methods (𝛿=0.07 °C and 𝜖=0.08 °C between Smartfin and LU, and 𝛿=0.00 °C and 𝜖=0.03 °C between Smartfin and LP) when compared with measurements in San Diego (𝛿=0.22 °C and 𝜖=0.23 °C between Smartfin and LU, and 𝛿=0.08 °C and 𝜖=0.11 °C between Smartfin and LP). Surfing SST data were found to agree well, in general, with independent temperature data from a nearby pier and benthic logger. Differences in SST between leash and Smartfin were found to correlate with PAR, both for the unprotected (LU) and protected (LP) TidbiT v2 sensors, explaining the regional differences in the comparison (PAR generally higher during US surfing sessions than UK sessions). Considering that the Smartfin is sheltered from ambient light by the surfboard, unlike the leash, results indicate the leash TidbiT v2 sensors warm with exposure to sunlight biasing the SST data positively, a result consistent with published tests on similar sensors in shallow waters. We matched all LU data collected prior to this study with satellite PAR products and corrected for solar heating. Results highlight the need to design temperature sensor packages that minimise exposure from solar heating when towed in the surface ocean.},

  abstract = {Coastal zones provide significant social and economic benefits to society and are home to the majority of the global population. While highly desirable, these areas are also some of the most affected by climate change and population growth. As climate change continues to progress and severe weather events become increasingly unpredictable, it is crucial to expand the collection of real time data that can improve forecasting, contribute to scientific research and provide information to assist with mitigation and planning efforts in coastal regions. Smartfin, a surfboard fin with a sensor that records sea surface temperature (SST) and GPS data, is a cost effective tool that enables surfers to contribute important oceanographic information to fill the data gaps and support scientific research while doing the activity they love. The purpose of this Capstone project is to find out what groups within the surf community would surf for science, what would motivate them to take part in citizen science and how much would they be willing to pay to participate. To answer these questions, a survey was designed exploring the habits, preferences, environmental views and use of technology among surfers. Using Qualtrics software, the survey was distributed to the surf community through social media. The results confirm the hypothesis that there are groups within surf community motivated to participate in citizen science and pay for a Smartfin.},
